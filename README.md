# Project Title :Voice Assistant Using Python Programming

# Overview
A voice assistant program is a software application that uses natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition to understand voice commands and perform tasks.

# Key Components
1. Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Interprets the meaning of the text.
3. Task Execution: Performs the desired action based on the interpreted text.

# Python Implementation
We'll use the following libraries:

- speech_recognition for speech recognition
- pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
- nltk for NLP tasks

# How it Works
1. The program initializes the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.
2. The program enters a loop where it listens for voice commands using the speech_recognition library.
3. When a voice command is detected, the program uses the recognize_google function to convert the spoken words into text.
4. The program then passes the text to the process_command function, which uses NLP to interpret the command.
5. Based on the interpreted command, the program responds with a text-to-speech message using the pyttsx3 library.
